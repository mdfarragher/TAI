# The case

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But a detailed analysis of houses and sales prices actually proves that these metrics have a much greater influence on price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

In this case study, you're going to answer the age-old question: what exactly determines the sales price of a house? 

And once you have your fully-trained model up and running, you can use it to predict the sales price of any house. Just plug in the relevant numbers and your model will generate a sales price prediction.

But how accurate will these predictions be? Can you actually use this model in business?

That's for you to find out! 

# The dataset

![The dataset](./assets/data.png)

In this case study you'll be working with the Iowa House Price dataset. This data set describes the sale of individual residential property in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010. 

The data set contains 1460 records and a large number of feature columns involved in assessing home values. You can use any combination of features you like to generate your house price predictions.

There is 1 file in the dataset:
* [data.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdfarragher/CLA/master/Regression/IowaHousing/data.csv) which contains 1460 records, 80 input features, and one output label. You will use this file to train and evaluate your model.

Download the file and save it locally.

Here's a description of all 81 columns in the training file:

## Getting started

Start by uploading the Iowa Housing datafile into Azure.

To save time, you can do this directly in your workspace. You don't have to set up a storage account and a datastore first. 

Just go to the Datasets page in your Azure Machine Learning workspace, click the +Create Dataset button, and then select From Local Files from the dropdown menu:

![Create new dataset](./assets/newdataset.png)

This will upload the Iowa Housing file directlty into your workspace, ready for use in a pipeline.

The pipeline for this case study is going to be very similar to the California Housing pipeline you already created. So to get started quickly, simply clone that pipeline: 

![Clone the pipeline](./assets/clonepipeline.png)

Then you only need to make the following changes:

* Replace the dataset module with the Iowa Housing dataset
* Remove the binning and conversion modules
* Change the SQL statement in the SQL Transformation module to perform whatever data processing you need
* Select the correct label column in the Train Model module.

## Your assignment

I want you to build a pipeline that reads the data file, processes it, and then trains a linear regression model on the data.

You can select any combination of input features you like, and you can perform any kind of data processing you like on the columns. 

Partition the data and use the trained model to make house price predictions on all the houses in the test partition. Calculate the best possible **RMSE** and **MAE** and share it in our Slack homework group. 

See if you can get the RMSE as low as possible. Share in our group how you did it. Which features did you select, how did you process them, and how did you configure your model? 

Good luck!
